To run the code, follow the steps:<br>
1 - Save all the files in a folder.<br>
2 - Open command prompt and change the directory to the folder in which the files are saved.<br>
3 - Then type "uvicorn main:app --reload". <br>
4 - A link will appear when it runs which will look something like "http://127.0.0.1:8000/". <br>
5 - In the browser when the link is opened, edit the link to "http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs" which will open the SwaggerUI page. <br>
