# Backend Task API
This API uses FASTAPI for API creation and SQLAlchemy for the database.
To run the code, follow the steps:
1 - Save all the files in a folder.
2 - Open command prompt and change the directory to the folder in which the files are saved.
3 - Then type "uvicorn main:app --reload"
4 - A link will appear when it runs which will look something like "http://127.0.0.1:8000/"
5 - In the browser when the link is opened, edit the link to "http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs" which will open the SwaggerUI page.
6 - In the SwaggerUI page it will display all the endpoints of the API and the datatype they are stored in. To test the endpoint you can click on the "Try It Out" button.
